🎓 A first-year university project to apply core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts through a car rental simulation system built in Java.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This is a simple Java desktop application simulating a car booking and rental system.  
Users can **book**, **rent**, and **pay** for vehicles — all within the same interface.

The project was developed to reinforce OOP concepts learned in class, using **Java Swing** for the UI and built using **Eclipse IDE**.

---

## ✨ Features

- 📅 **Car Booking**  
  Users can select available cars and book them by date and time.

- 🚘 **Car Rental Simulation**  
  Once booked, cars can be marked as "rented", simulating real-world behavior.

- 💳 **In-App Payment Simulation**  
  Users can simulate payment for their rentals directly through the app.

- 🧱 **OOP Architecture**  
  Uses concepts like:
  - Classes & Objects
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
  - Encapsulation
  - Abstraction

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- ☕ **Java** — Core programming language
- 🖼️ **Java Swing** — UI framework for desktop applications
- 💻 **Eclipse IDE** — Development environment

---


## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Java JDK installed (version 8 or later)
2. Open the project using **Eclipse IDE**
3. Run the `Main.java` file or the appropriate class with `main()` method
4. Explore the simulation: book → rent → pay!

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

This project helped me:
- Practice real-world **Java OOP** patterns
- Understand **event-driven programming** with Swing
- Learn how to structure classes for modularity and reusability
